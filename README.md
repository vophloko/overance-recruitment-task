# Overance Recruitment Task

## Important notes

This task is based on several key assumptions:

- Unless explicitly allowed in the task description, importing additional libraries is restricted to keep dependencies minimal.
- `devDependencies` can be expanded to demonstrate linting and formatting preferences.
- The application must pass accessibility requirements.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration
